## Project: Credit Baba
### Inspiration
Financial frauds are increasing day by day over the world the financial frauds has been increased by 56% since last 10 years. To reduce the frauds and to avoid corruption we have built this application. 

### What it does?
It predicts whether the person is eligible for loan or not based on financial history. Their are around 23 features, we have performed pre-processing techniques to remove the features that are not important. Then we have performed feature engineering to to find the top 12 features that are highly impacting the model. Then we have applied various Machine Learning models:
~Decision Trees
~Random Forest
~K Nearest Neighbor
~Support Vector Machines
~Adaboost
~Artificial Neural Networks
~Adaboost with base as Random Forest

### How we built it?
We built using Flask framework, python libraries and machine learning algorithms.

### Challenges we ran into?
Deploying the framework, integrating back-end with front-end of the flask frame work.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of ?
Successfully completed the prediction part with 63.37% accuracy with Random Forest and Adaboost ML model.

### What we learned ?
Teamwork, peer to peer learning, networking with different hackers worldwide, Flask, implementation of Artificial Neural Networks along with brushing up some previous concepts.
